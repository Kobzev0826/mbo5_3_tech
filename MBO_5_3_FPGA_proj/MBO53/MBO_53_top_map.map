Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "pll_1/physical_group_CLKDV_OUT/CLKDV_BUFG_INST" (output
   signal=clk_dv) has a mix of clock and non-clock loads. The non-clock loads
   are:
   Pin I1 of adc_02/Mmux_n007511
   Pin I1 of adc_01/Mmux_n007511

WARNING:Pack:1238 - The register uart_control/uart_rx/r_Rx_Data_R has the
   property IOB=TRUE, but failed to join the input side of an I/O component.
   Symbol uart_control/uart_rx/r_Rx_Data_R is not under the same hierarchy
   region as symbol uart_rx_d_IBUF. There are three ways to fix the problem:
   1. Put both symbols under the same hierarchy region and process the design.
   If the I/O buffer is being inferred by the synthesis tool, it is suggested to
   code I/O registers on the top level of code. If this can not be done, it is
   suggested to instantiate the proper I/O buffer in the lower level of code and
   disable I/O buffer inference for that port in the design.
   2. Remove KEEP_HIERARCHY constraint or add KEEP_HIERARCHY = FALSE to block
   uart_control/uart_rx in the UCF file.
   3. Run map with the option -ignore_keep_hierarchy (TCL/ProjNav command:
   process set "Allow Logic Optimization Across Hierarchy" TRUE). This option
   will dissolve all hierarchy in the design.

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
