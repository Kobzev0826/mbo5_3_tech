	#   "MBO_53_top" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc3s500e, package fg320, speed -5
	#Design creation date: 2021.12.21.19.30.27
	#ERROR:Place:665 - The design has 13 block-RAM components of which 13 block-RAM components require the adjacent multiplier site  to remain empty. This is because certain input pins of adjacent block-RAM and multiplier sites share routing ressources. In addition, the design has 8 multiplier components. Therefore, the design would require a total of 21 multiplier sites on the device. The current device has only 20 multiplier sites.
